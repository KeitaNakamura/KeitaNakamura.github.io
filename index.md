Keita Nakamura is a researcher at the Port and Airport Research Institute.
His research focuses on computational mechanics and its application to geotechnical engineering.
His prior research explored ground contamination, constitutive modeling of the anisotropic behavior of soils, and the finite strain theory in continuum mechanics.
Recently, he has shifted his focus to the material point method, actively contributing to the development of a frictional contact algorithm with rigid bodies and a new integration scheme.
